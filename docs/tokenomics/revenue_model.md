# Revenue model

The protocol generates revenue through a combination of activities: 

<h3>Trading</h3>

The protocol is designed to be the main liquidity provider for the tokens bootstrapped through the launchpad. On top of the variable Uniswap (or Pancakeswap) trading fee, the algorithmic structure of the liquidity allows the protocol to sell tokens with a higher markup compared to the market price. This mechanism enables the protocol to accrue revenue from trading and use it to strengthen the liquidity, allowing the floor price to bump.

<h3>Loans</h3>

When holders borrow from the liquidity, the protocol imposes an interest rate  of <b style='color:#FFD700'>0.0027%</b> per diem over the loan duration, charged upfront.  


<h2>Revenue sharing</h2>

Every time the floor price bumps, the protocol computes the amount of tokens which are minted to be used as rewards and shared between stakers, project founders and the Oikos Team. Rewards are minted in the native token, e.g. for the OKS/BNB pair, rewards are minted in OKS and backed by BNB in the floor position liquidity. The distribution is structured as follows: 

* <b style='color:#FFD700'>90%</b> to stakers 
* <b style='color:#FFD700'>5%</b> to founders
* <b style='color:#FFD700'>5%</b> to Oikos Team

This is done to incentivize creators to bootstrap their tokens on the Oikos platform and to reward the team for their work and continued efforts.
